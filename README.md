<h2 align="center">Description</h2>

**Notes for Life** is a challenge to complete the backend of a note-taking application. It involves the task of establishing routes and seamlessly connecting them with the frontend components, which presented a set of intriguing challenges for me. It began with some hurdles, such as identifying missing parts and effectively implementing them. Initially, the routes were puzzling, but after I got the first one, the others fell into place. I also faced some challenges using the starter code, which taught me a valuable lesson about variable names. The challenge was undeniably rewarding, especially when I saw the website live on Heroku, and I was able to create and delete posts.
