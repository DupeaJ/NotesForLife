<h2 align="center">Description</h2>
 Notes for life is a challenge to complete the backend of a note taker application. Starting with the task of establishing routes and connecting them seamlessly with the front-end components, NotesForLife presented a set of intriguing challenges for me. It began with some hurdles, such as identifying missing parts and implementing them effectively. The routes at first were puzzling but after i got the first one the others fell in hand. I also had some trouble using the starter code that taught me a valuable lesson about variable names. The challenge was definitely rewarding seeing the website live on heroku, and being able to create and delete post.
